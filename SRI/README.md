# 📊 Project SRI – Provincial Economic Analysis Using Tax Data (Data Analyst Case Study)
### 🔍 Overview

Project SRI is a data analysis case study inspired by Ecuador’s Servicio de Rentas Internas (SRI). The project analyzes provincial tax data to evaluate economic activity across regions and deliver clear, actionable insights for business and public-sector stakeholders.

The focus of this project is on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, trend evaluation, and insight communication—core responsibilities of a data analyst role.

### 🎯 Business Questions

This analysis answers practical, decision-oriented questions:

Which provinces generate the highest export activity?

Where is there strong purchasing activity but weaker sales performance?

How have sales and purchases evolved over time?

Is there evidence of a change in economic behavior following the 2023 government transition?

### 📈 Key Findings

✔ Top-performing provinces were identified as primary drivers of national exports.
✔ Several provinces show high purchasing levels without corresponding sales growth, signaling potential inefficiencies or untapped markets.
✔ Sales and purchase trends reveal regional disparities in economic momentum.
✔ A post-2023 comparison suggests measurable changes in economic activity that may align with the government transition.
