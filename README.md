Project SRI - Proyecto_SRI_Grupo4.ipynb: The project aims to replicate a real-world exercise as data scientists with a business focus, through a case study that provides a solution to a problem identified in a company. In this case we work with the Tax authority of Ecuador to identify which provinces generate the highest level of exports, which ones have a high level of purchases but not sales, and whether there has been an increase in sales or purchases in recent months. We also wanted to see if the new government has influenced sales growth at the end of 2023.
