- This project bridges the gap between technical data science and business strategy by solving a real-world problem through a simulated case study. In this case we work with the Tax authority of Ecuador to identify which provinces generate the highest level of exports, which ones have a high level of purchases but not sales, and whether there has been an increase in sales or purchases in recent months. We also wanted to see if the new government has influenced sales growth at the end of 2023.

We collected tweets about a specific restaurant in Guayaquil, Ecuador to understand what people are saying about the business, analyze whether the reviews are positive or negative, and identify potential sales strategies based on the feedback received.
- Moviews Review: The project topic was assigned by the instructor. The objective is to apply the techniques learned during the bootcamp, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), or graph analysis, while also incorporating a cost analysis component.
