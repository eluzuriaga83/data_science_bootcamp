# PROJECTS DESCRIPTIONS

### RFM
This project applies RFM technique for customer segregation.

### Project SRI: A data-driven case study analyzing Ecuador’s economic activity to translate provincial tax data into actionable insights for policy and business decision-making.
This project demonstrates how data science can directly inform business and public-policy decisions. Using a realistic, end-to-end case study inspired by Ecuador’s Tax Authority, I analyze economic activity across provinces to uncover actionable insights for decision-makers.

The analysis identifies which provinces drive the highest export volumes, highlights regions with strong purchasing activity but weak sales performance, and tracks recent trends in sales and purchases over time. In addition, the project evaluates whether the change in government at the end of 2023 correlates with measurable shifts in economic activity.

By combining data exploration, trend analysis, and business interpretation, this project showcases my ability to translate complex data into strategic insights—bridging the gap between technical analytics and real-world economic decision-making.

### Wordcloud: Restaurant Sentiment Analysis & Social Media Intelligence
A restaurant in Guayaquil, Ecuador needed to understand customer perception, identify service issues, and uncover growth opportunities from social media conversations.

What I Built:
Developed a text mining and sentiment analysis pipeline using Python to analyze Twitter conversations about the restaurant. Used natural language processing (NLP) to extract customer sentiment, identify trending topics, and visualize conversation patterns through word clouds and network analysis.

### Moviews Review
The project topic was assigned by the instructor. The objective is to apply the techniques learned during the bootcamp, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), or graph analysis, while also incorporating a cost analysis component.
