# PROJECTS DESCRIPTIONS

### Project SRI: A data-driven case study analyzing Ecuador’s economic activity to translate provincial tax data into actionable insights for policy and business decision-making.
This project demonstrates how data science can directly inform business and public-policy decisions. Using a realistic, end-to-end case study inspired by Ecuador’s Tax Authority, I analyze economic activity across provinces to uncover actionable insights for decision-makers.

The analysis identifies which provinces drive the highest export volumes, highlights regions with strong purchasing activity but weak sales performance, and tracks recent trends in sales and purchases over time. In addition, the project evaluates whether the change in government at the end of 2023 correlates with measurable shifts in economic activity.

By combining data exploration, trend analysis, and business interpretation, this project showcases my ability to translate complex data into strategic insights—bridging the gap between technical analytics and real-world economic decision-making.
